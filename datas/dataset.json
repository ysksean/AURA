The goal is to be professional, measured and constructive, not emotional or accusatory. Avoid using overly charged words like “unprofessiona’ \"toxic\" or “dishonest”. Instead, describe behaviours or pattems that can be addressed constructively For example, rather than pointing to sues with specific managers, you might say. “At times, I felt there was a lack of clear direction and consistency, which made it dificult for the team to feel supported and confident in priorities” That stil tells the truth. but ina way that HR can act on. Frame your points around the impact it had on your experience and abilty to perform to the best of your capability. Balance your feedback by also highlighting what you valued about the role or workplace. including the skils you developed. the people you enjoyed working with and the positive experiences you've had. Finally, don't hesitate to ask for confidentiality regarding what you share. © Got a careers question for Karren? Email bossingit@fabulousmaa.co.uk.",
