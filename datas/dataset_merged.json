The goal is to be professional, measured and constructive, not emotional or accusatory. Avoid using overly charged words like “unprofessiona’ \"toxic\" or “dishonest”. Instead, describe behaviours or pattems that can be addressed constructively For example, rather than pointing to sues with specific managers, you might say. “At times, I felt there was a lack of clear direction and consistency, which made it dificult for the team to feel supported and confident in priorities” That stil tells the truth. but ina way that HR can act on. Frame your points around the impact it had on your experience and abilty to perform to the best of your capability. Balance your feedback by also highlighting what you valued about the role or workplace. including the skils you developed. the people you enjoyed working with and the positive experiences you've had.

Uskyldig blondine den ene uka, regnbuehår neste? Miks som du vil!\n– Håret skal se mindre tilgjort ut, vi jobber mer med den naturlige bevegelsen, tenk på et par jeans; du må gå dem til for at de skal bli skikkelig komfortable. Det samme gjelder håret, sier Marta Spizewska, talsperson for Wella i Skandinavia.\nOgså hårproduktene blir grønnere. For det nordiske håret som trenger hjelp under tøffe klimatiske forhold, lanseres produkter med ingredienser som vitamin A og C, samt kalsium, jern og magnesium. Panthenol og koffein er nøkkelingredienser i mange hårprodukter fremover.\n– Panthenol gir fukt og gjør at håret ser sunnere ut, koffein stimulerer hodebunnen og skaper et godt vekstmiljø for håret. Men den klareste trenden er at man ser etter unike former og flere fordeler i ett og samme produkt, fremfor å fokusere på enkeltingredienser, sier Marta Spizewska.\nTrenden med pleiende håroljer videreutvikles, blant annet med mer tyngende produkter og lette oljesprayer som pleier, gir glans og reduserer brus.\n– Det kommer blant annet eliksirer med nye kremteksturer, som er lettere enn noen annen krempleie for hår med olje som hovedingrediensen, sier Ane Kathrine Berglund i L'Oréal Norge.",

Vi kommer til å se steinvaskede brunetter og blondiner i transparente nyanser. Til våren kommer pastellnyansene for fullt, forteller Marta Spizewska i Wella.\nMen slapp av, mange av hårfargene har kortere varighet – sånn i tilfelle du skulle bli lei av lilla sveis. Dermed kan du leke med ulike farger, bytte ut og eksperimentere. Nye hårfargemetoder gjør det også mulig å legge inn flere nyanser uten folie.\n– Fargeprosessen blir raskere og mer kreativ, med et skreddersydd resultat der hårfargene er naturlig mikset.

Estée Lauder solves the problem with its new felt-tip liner, which is half the size of a normal tube, making application easier. First, line your lids with a pencil, then retrace the liquid on top, as seen above at Dolce & Gabbana. Or learn the technique with the online tutorial \"How to: Winged Eyeliner\" at cupcakesandcashmere.com. Hide mistakes (and under-eye circles) with a concealer like Napoleon Perdis the One. MAXIMIZE YOUR LASHES Perhaps you splurged on lash extensions for the party season or you swiped on more mascara than your lashes could handle. If you're now plagued with thin wispy stubs, you don't have to go mascara-free waiting for regrowth. \"During the day, use a nourishing formula to keep your lashes in good condition,\" says Maulawizada. We like By Terry Mascara Terrybly ($46); it contains plant proteins and hyaluronic acid to help extend your growth cycle and add length and volume.➤",

It's a splurge but it works.\" Kow,\nfrom Westport, Conn., also came in to use a\nFresh mailer, which offered her a free product\nsample. As a gift for spending more than\n$100, she received travel sizes of Soy Fresh\nCleanser and Seaberry Restorative Body Cream.\n\"Fresh has a very calming environment,\" says\nKow. While she also likes to shop at Saks and\nBloomingdale's for beauty products, stores like\nSephora are too \"overwhelmingly scented\" for her. \"I started coming to Fresh in\n2009 and have been shopping the brand since,\" she says.",

His startup, Consequential Robotics, is developing robotic wheelchairs and kitchen helpers – but its first product is a puppy. A friendly, autonomous robo-dog, MiRo is intended to help keep elderly people safe by reminding them to take medication, suggesting a cup of tea to keep them hydrated, informing them that it’s cold outside or contacting assis- tance if they fall. “We’re trying to reverse-engineer nature and mimic biology, so MiRo is completely auton- omous,” Conran explains. “It can find its way around and charge itself, and doesn’t need to be told what to do.” As a child, Conran, who is the son of designer Terence Conran, wanted to be an inventor. He intended to study mechanical engineering, “but my dad told me to do industrial design”. In 2001, he was appointed designer in residence at the University of Sheffield. It was there that he began working with roboticists: “I took their slightly awkward devices and made them emotionally engaging,” he says. In 2014, he designed the Buddi wristband, a GPS tracker for older people, which can detect a fall. Conran, 60, says the project made him realise that “emotionally engaging design had a great deal to offer the engineering community”. With this in mind, he teamed up with Sheffield roboticists Tony Prescott and Ben",

The companion links several sensors, including a wristband that monitors vital signs. Its six senses include touch sensi- tivity and sharp hearing. MiRo uses its sonar sense to help navigate surroundings, and whereas many companion bots rely on voice control, it also responds when its associated wristband is touched. “Instructions include hugging for help or slapping for stopping,” Conran says. “It’s good for people who may be cognitively impaired.” MiRo is available as a software kit for developers, and a £600 consumer version will go on sale in September 2018. In the meantime, Conran is also developing a robotic wheelchair and an automated kitchen with arms that can cook. He calls his approach “human-centred”, but it’s closer to animal-centred. “In many respects,” he says, “animals are much smarter than today’s robots.” Clare Dowdy consequentialrobotics.com",

I started collaging for fun at\nfirst, and I was immediately drawn to\nhow freeing the medium was and how\nmuch I could communicate through\nsmall gestures or compositions.

In-\nstead of opening a music app on\nmy phone, I hit the Seek button\nand catch snatches of local news\nreports, bluegrass, and songs I\ncan't place. This is my favorite part of traveling\nby car. I love listening in on the soundtrack that\nplays for people in a town that isn't mine. And\nafter the past year, it's a much-needed break\nfrom the routine.\nI feel the tension melt from my shoulders\nnow that we're on the road. In mid-February\n2020, just before the start of the pandemic,\nthe Navy moved my husband and me and our\ntwo toddlers to Dallas after two years in Japan.\nLike so many others, we spent the next year\nbecoming intimately familiar with the layout\nof our house instead of exploring new places.\nWe worried about the health of our parents,\nwondered how to navigate this economy, and\nlearned how to become a family again after two\nyears of back-to-back deployments. I traveled\nvirtually on Google Maps by dropping a pin\non global destinations I dreamed of visiting.\nFinally, exactly a year after we moved back to\nTexas, we felt comfortable enough to pursue\na real, nonvirtual getaway.\nWe almost didn't make it, though. My family\nhad spent the week bundled up in our home\nduring the historic winter blackout. We were\nlucky to have enough electricity every day to\neat hot meals before the house went dark again.\nEach morning, I woke to boil-water notices\ncreeping closer to our neighborhood. I won-\ndered if we were next. So, with the roads driv-\nable again, we stuck with our original travel\nplans, and two days after one famous politician\ngot caught escaping Texas during the crisis, I\ntoo am cruising out of the state with my spouse\nand kids. As we head southeast of town, the\nyellow line that normally marks the side of\nHighway 75 is replaced with white slash. Even\nthe Red River has changed its colors. The sun\nhits the water just right, and I see it's encrusted\nwith ice and snow. The opening notes of a Bob-\nEarl Keen classic float into our SUV as we\ncut through Oklahoma on our way to northwest\nArkansas. I haven't given the song a thought in\nyears, but the lyrics roll off my tongue: “They\njumped into his pickup, Sonny jammed her\ndown in gear / Sonny looked at Sherry, said,\n'Let's get on outta here.'\"\nFor my family, Arkansas has been a location\nfor refueling in only the literal sense: a quick\nstop on the way to somewhere else.
